        What is a grid?
    </p>

    <p>
        A grid is a set of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines defining columns and rows. Elements can be placed onto the grid within these column and row lines. CSS grid layout has the following features:
        Fixed and flexible track sizes
    </p>

    <p>
        You can create a grid with fixed track sizes â€“ using pixels for example. This sets the grid to the specified pixel which fits to the layout you desire. You can also create a grid using flexible sizes with percentages or with the new fr unit designed for this purpose.
        Item placement
    </p>

    <p>
        You can place items into a precise location on the grid using line numbers, names or by targeting an area of the grid. Grid also contains an algorithm to control the placement of items
